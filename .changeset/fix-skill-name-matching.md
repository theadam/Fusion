Fix skill name matching between Fusion's two-segment names (e.g. `web-research/SKILL.md`) and pi-coding-agent's bare directory names (e.g. `web-research`). Patterns and requested skill names now strip the `/SKILL.md` suffix before comparison, eliminating spurious "not found in discovered skills" warnings.
