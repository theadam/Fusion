Hardened CLI packaging against native module build regressions by asserting `dockerode`/`ssh2`/`cpu-features` remain externalized in tsup bundle config, preventing native `.node` artifact strings from being inlined into the bundle, and declaring `dockerode` as a runtime dependency for published installs.
