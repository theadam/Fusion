Fix merger subject derivation and add a race-rescue layer to the autostash.

The deterministic fallback now prefers the lowest-numbered `complete Step N` headline (or the oldest commit) over the most-recent commit, and the AI subject/body prompts weight by commit theme instead of file size — so a small token-cleanup fixup that touches a large file no longer hijacks the squash-merge subject.

The pre-merge autostash now re-snapshots the working tree after the primary stash is persisted but before `git reset --hard` runs, capturing any dirty paths that landed between the initial snapshot and the destructive wipe (concurrent dev edits during a long merger run, parallel merger runs interleaving, or late test/build artifacts) into a separate `race-rescue` stash so they're recoverable from `git stash list`.
