Fix the dashboard usage indicator popup so the footer (Last updated timestamp, Refresh, and Close buttons) is always visible, and make the popup resizable with the size persisted across sessions.

- Changed the modal/popover to a flex column so the scrollable provider list can shrink while the header and action footer stay pinned. Previously the inner content used `max-height: 60vh` while the popover wrapper capped at 70vh with `overflow: hidden`, which pushed the footer below the visible area on shorter viewports or when many providers were configured.
- Added native `resize: both` to the desktop popover and modal variants, with sensible min sizes. The popover now anchors via `left` (computed from the trigger button's right edge) instead of `right`, so dragging the bottom-right resize handle behaves as expected.
- Persist the user's chosen width/height per project in `localStorage` under a new `kb-usage-modal-size` scoped key (debounced via `ResizeObserver`). The saved size is reapplied on next open.
