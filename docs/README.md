# Fusion Documentation

[← Back to repository root](../README.md)

Fusion is an AI-orchestrated task board that turns ideas into reviewed, merged code using a structured workflow: **planning → todo → in-progress → in-review → done**.

![Fusion Dashboard Overview](screenshots/dashboard-overview.png)

## Quick Start

Start the local dashboard with `pnpm dev dashboard`, then create your first task from the board or CLI.

For a full walkthrough (installation, onboarding, first task, and daily workflow basics):
