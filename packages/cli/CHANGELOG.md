## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- cf0ea34: Add a new `fn research` command group for managing research runs from the CLI, including create, list, show, export, cancel, and retry flows with JSON-friendly output options.

### Patch Changes

- bdf91f8: Fix mobile chat view layout when the iOS keyboard is up so the message input stays anchored above the keyboard instead of being pushed to the top of the screen.
- 23134cf: Keep mobile chat composer focused when tapping Send so the keyboard stays open and messages send on the first tap.
- 72dffe4: Fix Quick Chat mobile send button so the first tap while keyboard is open sends the message instead of only dismissing the keyboard.
- 41e5458: Keep the mobile keyboard open in Quick Chat after tapping send so users can continue typing without an extra tap.
- 7f55dde: Preserve Quick Chat input focus on mobile send taps so the keyboard stays open.
- a16ca0a: Seal readonly AI agent sessions so summarizers (title, merge subject, merge body, merge summary) cannot reach host-injected `fn_*` mutation tools or caller-supplied custom tools. Harden all four summarizer system prompts with explicit "do not call tools / treat input as content" framing, wrap the title prompt in a `<description>` delimiter, and sanitize the AI response (strip chatty preambles, markdown emphasis, surrounding quotes, trailing punctuation) before returning. Prevents a class of incidents where the title summarizer would call `fn_task_create` mid-summary and store its chat-style reply as the title.
- ecabab8: Show task provenance as "Created by <agent name>" for agent-created tasks and make the agent name clickable to open the agent detail modal.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 28e6819: Add first-class Research configuration and readiness workflows across settings and dashboard surfaces. This introduces scoped Research defaults/overrides, exposes Research in experimental feature toggles, and routes missing-provider/missing-credentials setup through existing Settings and Authentication flows while keeping API keys in auth storage.

### Patch Changes

- 97bb80e: Fix backup routine sync failures on legacy SQLite databases by backfilling missing `routines` columns (including `agentId`) during database initialization. Auto-backup settings now create/update the `Database Backup` routine without logging `table routines has no column named agentId` on upgraded installs.
- 451c6d8: Add read-only `fn_insight_*` pi extension tools so agents can list and inspect persisted insights and recent insight-generation runs directly from the project `InsightStore`.
- 3443aed: Ship a bundled Nerd Font symbols fallback for the dashboard terminal so patched glyphs render even when users do not have a local Nerd Font installed. The dashboard now preloads `/fonts/SymbolsNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf`, applies it first in the xterm font stack, and includes build-output regression checks for the bundled font artifact and preload reference.
- d7fdff4: Move `experimentalFeatures` and `remoteAccess` from project-scoped settings to global-scoped settings, including settings schema/type updates, save-path migration, dashboard routes/UI, and regression coverage updates.
- 13ed470: Fix the mobile QuickChat panel layout when the iOS keyboard opens. The panel now stays anchored to the visible viewport (no off-screen drift on a refocus after the keyboard was dismissed), the soft keyboard reliably comes up the moment the FAB is tapped (a stealth input claims focus inside the user gesture so iOS opens the keyboard even before the real composer is enabled), the panel snaps back to full height immediately on blur instead of trailing the keyboard slide-down, and the model name in the header pill collapses to a provider icon when it would otherwise overflow.
- 40620a9: Keep the terminal modal header on a single row on mobile. The tab bar now flexes to fill remaining width and stays scrollable, while the action cluster pins to the right edge of the same row instead of stacking onto a second row.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 3218c05: Add support for custom OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible API providers. Users can add, edit, and remove custom providers from Settings → Authentication or during model onboarding, with automatic ModelRegistry registration and live updates without restart.
- 3fcf5f4: Detect pre-existing Tailscale funnel sessions in Remote Access settings, surface external tunnel status in `/api/remote/status`, and add a kill-external tunnel endpoint plus Settings UI actions to adopt or restart cleanly.

### Patch Changes

- f7df0d4: Improve mobile keyboard overlap detection so chat layout resizes reliably (including smaller iOS viewport shifts) without pushing fixed app chrome.
- 21402a3: Fix vitest test-harness regressions that masked correct production code as failing tests:

  - Restore `util.promisify(exec)`/`util.promisify(execFile)` to resolve with `{stdout, stderr}` inside the test child-process guard. The previous wrapper dropped the `[util.promisify.custom]` symbol, so awaited `execAsync` resolved to a raw stdout string and broke any test or runtime path that destructured the result (cli `init` git commit flow, core git-remote project-name detection, engine cron-runner / restart / worktree-pool clusters, etc.).
  - Allow cheap CLI introspection invocations (`--version`, `--help`, `which …`) through the AI-CLI block so the dashboard's claude availability probe can tell the truth about the local system. Session-launching invocations (e.g. `claude -p …`, `droid chat`) still throw.
  - Give SIGTERM'd subprocesses a short grace period in the per-test guard's `afterEach` before flagging them as "left running", fixing a race where production code that correctly killed the child was reported as leaking it.
  - Add a test-only `__registerMissionInterviewSessionForTest` helper so SSE replay/buffer tests can exercise the stream manager without spinning up a real AI agent.
  - Fix executor mock to simulate real step-transition semantics (forward moves persist; in-progress regressions on done/skipped steps get rejected) so the new `persistedStatus`-aware response text in `fn_task_update` is exercised correctly.
  - Fix the iOS last-resort path test in `useMobileKeyboard` to actually reach the `gap < 16 && viewportShrink ≥ 16` branch by setting `vv.offsetTop > 0`.
  - Convert `await import("../server.js")` in 14 dashboard route tests to static imports so first-test latency in those files drops from ~2–5s to <200ms.

- 98c3c22: Stop wiping accumulated step progress and the worktree pointer on internal task bounces. Workflow-step REVISE retries, pause→todo handoffs, and the context-overflow fresh-session requeue all moved tasks back to `todo` before returning to `in-progress`, and the default reopen-to-todo path was resetting every step to `pending` and rewriting PROMPT.md checkboxes — so each retry restarted the agent from step 0 even though earlier steps were already done. `moveTask` now accepts a `preserveResumeState` flag that the executor sets on those internal hops; user-initiated "move back to todo" still gets the clean-slate behavior. The context-overflow path additionally clears `sessionFile` synchronously so the next dispatch can no longer reopen the saturated session. `fn_task_update` no longer silently regresses a `done`/`skipped` step to `in-progress`, no longer captures a stale rewind checkpoint when it does, and tells the agent honestly when a regression is ignored. Mobile chat keyboard handling now keeps the layout adjusted on iOS even when the visual-viewport overlap reads as zero (focused input + viewport shrink).
- 491097c: Prefer a Nerd Font-capable monospace stack in the dashboard interactive terminal so powerline/private-use glyphs render correctly when patched fonts are installed, while preserving existing fallback monospace behavior.
- f118606: Stop blocking the Node event loop on every chat send. The pi-claude-cli extension factory used to run two `execSync` probes (`claude --version`, `claude auth status`) on every `createFnAgent` call, which Fusion invokes per chat message — so each send froze every other dashboard API for a few seconds while the Claude CLI cold-started. Probes now run async via `spawn` and are memoized to once per process.

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- 299b66e: Fix InProcessRuntime creating a nested `.fusion/.fusion/fusion.db`. RoutineStore was being constructed with the project's `.fusion` directory, but its constructor appends `.fusion` internally. Pass the project root instead, matching AutomationStore.
- c3c8007: Add ghost-review fallback recovery to the self-healing maintenance loop. Catches any `in-review` task that fell through every more-specific recovery scan and has been idle past `taskStuckTimeoutMs`, kicks it back to `todo` with transient status cleared. Preserves human-handoff (`awaiting-user-review`, `awaiting-approval`) and active-merge (`merging`, `merging-pr`) statuses; rate-limited naturally by `updatedAt` refresh so a re-stuck task can only be kicked once per timeout window.
- 24e142d: Merge commits now get an AI-generated summary subject describing what changed (e.g. `feat(FN-XXXX): add user-invited webhook handler`) instead of the bare `feat(FN-XXXX): merge fusion/fn-XXXX`. The merger calls the existing `summarizeCommitSubject` lane alongside the body summarizer; on failure or when disabled, falls back to the legacy `merge <branch>` form.

  Default for `useAiMergeCommitSummary` is now `true` (was `false`). Existing projects that haven't explicitly set the flag will pick up the new behavior on next start. The Settings UI already exposes the toggle.

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- bb9b0f1: Preserve in-progress card timers and stats across internal workflow rerun bounces.

## 0.9.2

### Minor Changes

- 9e5ac3c: Add an optional `useAiMergeCommitSummary` project setting that enables AI-generated merge commit summaries using the title summarizer model lane, with deterministic fallback when disabled or unavailable.
- 19cdf7f: Add dashboard support for managing custom OpenAI/Anthropic/Google-compatible providers via Settings and onboarding advanced sections, backed by new custom-provider API routes and models.json persistence.
- 7eec105: Heartbeat prompts now re-anchor every tick on a Wake Delta + Heartbeat Procedure (paperclip-parity) so permanent agents stop silently grinding on prior tasks. Each tick the agent receives a structured wake delta (source, wake reason, assigned task, pending messages, triggering comments) and re-runs a 7-step procedure (identity → inbox → wake delta → assignment review → pick action → persist → exit) before continuing prior work.

  The procedure is overridable per agent via a new `heartbeatProcedurePath` field pointing at a project-relative markdown file; the file is reloaded fresh each tick so operators can edit it live without restarting agents. New non-ephemeral agents default to `.fusion/HEARTBEAT.md`, and existing agents can be backfilled onto that path via `POST /api/agents/:id/upgrade-heartbeat-procedure` (also surfaced as an "Upgrade to Default Heartbeat Procedure" button in the agent detail Config tab). The default file is seeded from the built-in template on first use; subsequent edits are preserved.

### Patch Changes

- 6c051b1: Fix the update notification release notes link so it points to the repo changelog.
- 64b5f67: Register custom providers from global settings with the pi ModelRegistry at startup, so they appear as available models without restart.
- cfc8aa3: Fix TUI header overflow when a remote tunnel is configured. Between 100 and 175 columns the remote URL was pushing the left edge (logo + tabs) offscreen; the remote info now lives in a flex-shrinkable, right-justified slot that truncates instead of overflowing. Also gives the QR overlay a solid background so it no longer renders transparent over the underlying TUI.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 76deb48: Fix Active Agents panel cards stuck on "Connecting...". Agents in `active` state without a current task have no SSE stream to attach to, so the card now shows "Idle — no task assigned" instead of misleading network copy ("Starting..." for the brief `running`-without-task race). Also fixes a related SSE multiplexer bug: subscribers joining a channel that had already opened never received an `onOpen` callback (EventSource only emits `open` once), leaving them at `isConnected: false` indefinitely whenever another component was already streaming the same task's logs.
- f6242c2: Hoist the Active Agents panel above the main agent list and surface next-heartbeat ETA. Live work now sits directly under the stats bar so it's visible without scrolling past the full agent directory. Each card footer renders "Next heartbeat in Xs" (or "Heartbeat overdue Xs" when the deadline has passed) using the agent's `runtimeConfig.heartbeatIntervalMs` with the dashboard default fallback. Cards also gain pointer cursor + hover/focus styling so the existing click-to-select behavior is discoverable.
- 7e832bb: Clear stale agent task links when tasks become terminal or are deleted, fall back to no-task heartbeat instruction runs for archived assignments, and expand built-in agent prompts with explicit heartbeat guidance.
- 118a03a: Keep experimental dashboard views off by default until project settings enable them.
- 291e156: Improve the Git Manager diff layout and file path truncation in dashboard modals.
- c6d67b9: Insights view: two-pane layout (categories sidebar + scrollable detail), full insight content (no line-clamp), larger action icons, fixed scrolling, and mobile single-row header.
- d8baa7a: Show tasks created from planning sessions on the board immediately without requiring a refresh.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- a654795: Generate richer merge commit messages via the AI summarizer. The merger now routes commit-body summarization through the consolidated `ai-summarize.ts` pipeline (using the title-summarization model), with an AI fallback cascade to guarantee non-empty merge bodies. Summarization model is configurable in settings.
- 91f9f20: Add unified multi-node task routing across CLI, dashboard, core, and engine flows.

  - **Routing model:** Tasks can set a per-task node override with project-level pinned default node fallback. `resolveEffectiveNode()` computes the effective routing target per task.
  - **Core types:** Adds `Task.nodeId`, `UnavailableNodePolicy` (`"block" | "fallback-local"`), `ProjectSettings.defaultNodeId`, and `ProjectSettings.unavailableNodePolicy`.
  - **Engine behavior:** Adds effective-node resolution (per-task override → project default → local), unavailable-node policy enforcement, and routing activity event logging.
  - **Active-task guard:** Blocks node override changes for in-progress tasks via `validateNodeOverrideChange()`.
  - **Dashboard updates:** Adds project settings controls for default node and unavailable-node policy, task detail routing summary (effective node, routing source, fallback policy, blocking reason), quick task creation node picker, bulk node override actions, and node health/status indicators in selectors.
  - **CLI updates:** Adds `fn settings set defaultNodeId <node-id>`, `fn settings set unavailableNodePolicy <block|fallback-local>`, `fn task set-node <id> <node>`, `fn task clear-node <id>`, `fn task create --node <name>`, and routing details in `fn task show`.
  - **Schema updates:** Includes tasks table migration adding the `nodeId` column.

- e46f2d4: Add pluggable notification provider system with built-in ntfy and webhook support.
- 17a072c: Add `requirePrApproval` setting (related to [#21](https://github.com/Runfusion/Fusion/issues/21)).

  When `mergeStrategy: "pull-request"`, GitHub's `required: true` flag for status checks only flows from branch protection — a Pro feature on private repos. On free private repos, `isPrMergeReady` reports every fresh PR as immediately mergeable, so `autoMerge: true` causes Fusion to auto-squash-merge the moment the PR opens with no chance for a human to review it.

  The new `requirePrApproval` setting (project-level, default `false`) makes Fusion hold the merge until at least one approving GitHub review is present (`reviewDecision === "APPROVED"`), independent of GitHub's server-side enforcement. Surfaces in the dashboard's Merge settings panel under the Pull Request strategy. Lets you use Fusion's PR mode as "open the PR, wait for me to approve and merge" on any tier.

- 1beebc0: Allow tasks to be respecified from `in-review`. `VALID_TRANSITIONS["in-review"]` now includes `triage`, so the dashboard's `Request AI Revision` and `Rebuild Spec` actions work for in-review tasks. Moving an in-review task to triage performs the same full reset as in-review → todo (clears branch/baseBranch/baseCommitSha/summary/recovery metadata and workflowStepResults) so the next run starts from scratch. The in-review card's `Move` menu also now offers `Planning` as a destination.

### Patch Changes

- 48208db: Surface live run status on Active Agent cards instead of a generic "Connecting…" placeholder. The card now polls the agent's task and shows the current step (e.g. _"Step 5/8: Write Tests"_) and executor model while the SSE log stream warms up. A new "Live logs" button on the card opens the task detail modal directly on the Logs tab.
- a654795: Prefer `merge-base` over potentially stale `baseCommitSha` when resolving task diff bases in the dashboard. Diffs no longer drift when the recorded base commit lags behind the actual divergence point.
- a654795: Show only files actually changed by the task in `ChangesDiffModal` and `TaskChangesTab`. The diff baseline is no longer flooded with files that weren't touched by the task itself.
- a654795: Close executor/merger concurrency races and reviewer pause TOCTOU. Worktree lifecycle is now synchronized more defensively across executor and merger paths, the reviewer pause/unpause flow is hardened against time-of-check/time-of-use races, and `AgentSemaphore` now guards against invalid limits (NaN, Infinity).
- 17a072c: Fix agent heartbeat scheduling so disabled agents stay disabled and active timers are not reset by unrelated agent updates.
- a654795: Read assistant text from session state when processing memory dreams. Dream extraction no longer misses content when the assistant message has not been flushed to the output stream yet.
- b91533c: Fix PR-mode merge flow (related to [#21](https://github.com/Runfusion/Fusion/issues/21)):

  - **PR-mode now pushes the per-task branch to origin before creating the PR.** `processPullRequestMergeTask` previously called `gh pr create --head fusion/<task-id>` without ever publishing the branch, so the PR creation failed and the task stalled in `in-review`. The branch is now pushed via `git push -u origin <branch>` immediately before `createPr` (skipped when an existing PR already covers the branch).
  - **Removed dead `autoCreatePr` setting** from the schema and `Settings` type. It was defined as a default but never read anywhere.

- 7f42c7f: Fix [#21](https://github.com/Runfusion/Fusion/issues/21): the `recover-mergeable-review` maintenance sweep no longer bypasses `autoMerge` and `mergeStrategy`. The sweep now early-returns when `autoMerge !== true` (or when the engine is paused) and routes recovery merges through the engine's merge queue so `mergeStrategy: "pull-request"` is honored — eligible in-review tasks go through `processPullRequestMerge` instead of a raw local `git merge`. Operators using a PR-based review flow with `autoMerge: false` will no longer have tasks silently merged behind their back.
- 9ce811a: Remote access (Tailscale) overhaul: the auth/scan URL now uses the live `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` URL captured from `tailscale funnel` instead of a constructed `http://<hostname>:<port>` from a configured label, so QR codes lead to a working public endpoint. The hostname label is no longer required (engine validation and the Settings UI both dropped it; `tailscale funnel` never used it). QR codes are now rendered with the `qrcode` library — previously the SVG was just the URL drawn as text — and a new `format=terminal` returns ASCII QR for the TUI. The Tailscale readiness parser now waits for the line containing the URL before flipping to `running`, fixing missing-URL captures. Dashboard polls remote status while `starting`/`stopping` so state updates without reopening the modal. The TUI shows a global `● tunnel` indicator with URL in the header when running, and `Ctrl+Q` opens an ASCII QR overlay anywhere in the app.
- a654795: Restore task card timing and changes fallbacks (FN-2877). The dashboard task card again falls back gracefully when timing data or change summaries are missing, preventing blank states on tasks that haven't reported metrics yet.
- bb5402a: Keep task card timer live while a task is actively merging (FN-2920). The in-review timer was driven by per-step instrumented duration, which freezes during the merge phase, so a stuck merge could read "3m" indefinitely. While `status` is `merging`/`merging-pr` the card now shows live elapsed since the merger flipped the status, with a "Merging Nm" tooltip.
- a654795: Surface visible feedback when copying a log entry from the dashboard TUI. The Logs panel title now flashes a "Copied!" / "Copy failed" status so the action is no longer silent.
- a654795: Stack Utilities and Settings under Stats in the dashboard TUI wide layout (≥150 columns). Logs now fills the full right column for its full height; Stats flex-grows in the left column above fixed-height Utilities and Settings, so Stats absorbs all leftover vertical space.

## 0.8.4

### Patch Changes

- 1c4c08b: Verify and tighten npm bundle fixes from FN-2897: keep the vendored pi-claude-cli runtime on Node built-in child_process APIs (no cross-spawn dependency), confirm Claude CLI extension resolution works from the published dist/pi-claude-cli layout, and ensure prepack strips private @fusion/\* workspace devDependencies from the published package manifest.
- 3202e57: Fix SQLite project and central database validation so dashboard and desktop startup handle corrupt database files more predictably.
- 858e244: Fix the TUI startup update notice to use the same version source and cached update gating as the rest of the CLI.
- 995165e: Fix the dashboard version label so it matches the version used by update notifications.
- bd14cf8: Fix Windows path handling for worktree detection and home-directory lookups.
- 995165e: Fix worktree creation failure when git reports "already checked out at" instead of "already used by worktree at"
- 10d565e: Fix OAuth login redirect for non-localhost dashboard access (Tailscale, Cloudflare, LAN).

## 0.8.3

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 531b13e: Recover automatically from SQLite FTS5 corruption errors during task upserts by rebuilding the `tasks_fts` index and retrying once. Also adds FTS5 index rebuild/integrity helpers in core database code and extends task store health checks to validate FTS5 integrity.
- 531b13e: Add executor watchdogs to recover stuck `fn_task_done` and workflow rerun handoffs faster.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- a8dbdbc: Include linked GitHub issue references (`Ref: owner/repo#N`) in executor and merger commit message instructions and merger fallback commits when tasks are sourced from GitHub issues.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 58510e1: Add CLI support for multi-node routing: configure project default node (`fn settings set defaultNodeId`), unavailable-node policy (`fn settings set unavailableNodePolicy`), per-task node overrides (`fn task set-node`, `fn task clear-node`), and `--node` flag for `fn task create`.
- 81c6f01: Add node routing policy enforcement: when a task is routed to a node that is offline or unhealthy, the project's `unavailableNodePolicy` setting controls whether execution is blocked (task stays in todo) or falls back to local execution. Supports `defaultNodeId` project setting for pinned default nodes and per-task `nodeId` overrides. Routing decisions are logged to task activity for visibility.
- c9241d8: Add pluggable notification provider system with built-in ntfy and webhook support.
- 22bac2d: Refactor merge conflict strategies into two `smart-*` flavors and change the default to "prefer main".

  Both smart strategies now run a best-effort `git fetch` + fast-forward of local main from `origin` before the merge cascade — a freshly-pushed sibling commit no longer gets clobbered when the fallback resolves a conflict against a stale base. They differ only in the per-file final fallback:

  - **`smart-prefer-main`** (new default): `-X ours` — main wins. Best when concurrent agents could regress just-merged sibling work.
  - **`smart-prefer-branch`**: `-X theirs` — task branch wins. Equivalent to the previous `"smart"` behavior.

  Legacy enum values are accepted for backwards compatibility and normalized at load time: `"smart"` → `"smart-prefer-branch"`, `"prefer-main"` → `"smart-prefer-main"`. Settings on disk continue to work without changes.

### Patch Changes

- f19ecac: Add dedicated POST /api/memory/dream endpoint and triggerMemoryDreams() client helper for manual dream processing.
- cc9181d: Recover automatically from SQLite FTS5 corruption during task upserts by rebuilding the `tasks_fts` index and retrying once, and add FTS5 integrity checks to database health monitoring.
- 5cc7597: Fix npm bundle reliability for the published CLI package by removing the vendored pi-claude-cli `cross-spawn` runtime dependency, validating bundled pi-claude-cli resolution from `dist/`, and preventing private `@fusion/*` workspace dev dependencies from leaking into the packed manifest.
- 2029968: Fix project-level model overrides so they take precedence over the default model fallback consistently across dashboard and engine AI flows.
- cd03c6a: Add runfusion.ai links to dashboard update-available notices in the banner and settings modal.
- 7227b87: Add a retry button to failed task error boxes on dashboard task cards so users can retry directly from the card without opening task details.
- 198f85c: Fix dashboard onboarding: the "Welcome to Fusion" setup wizard is now scrollable on short viewports (older laptops / browsers without `dvh` support), and the model-onboarding modal reliably opens after the wizard closes on a fresh install instead of racing it or being suppressed.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- ce6dcef: fix(0.7.1): mobile polish, modal layout fixes, paperclip CLI parity, schema migration

  Mobile / dashboard:

  - ModelOnboardingModal: dialog was off-screen on phones because the desktop `min-width: 640px` won over the mobile `max-width: 100%`. Reset min-width/min-height to 0 in the mobile media query (with `!important` so persisted desktop sizes from `useModalResizePersist` cannot re-pin it). Compact provider cards: keep the icon inline beside the name + description, shrink the icon container, drop name/description font sizes, and rely on flex-wrap so the API-key actions still drop to their own row underneath. The API-key input + Save button now live on a single row at the full card width — input grows left-aligned, Save shrinks to the right with a hairline of inline padding.
  - NewAgentDialog: the dialog's top was rendering hidden behind the in-page Agents header on mobile. Render the dialog through `createPortal(..., document.body)` so the overlay escapes the `.agents-view` stacking context. Mobile media query also drops the overlay padding, fills 100vw / 100dvh with safe-area insets on header/footer for iOS notch + home indicator, and fixes the classic flex `min-height: auto` bug that prevented `overflow-y: auto` on the body from activating.
  - TerminalModal: same root cause as the onboarding modal — desktop `min-width: 480px` / `min-height: 320px` pinned the modal off-screen on phones. Reset to 0 in the mobile rule with `!important` so persisted desktop sizes can't override.
  - WorkflowStepManager: fix React error #310 ("Rendered more hooks than during the previous render") that prevented the workflow steps panel from loading. `useOverlayDismiss` was being called after an `if (!isOpen) return null` early return, so the hook count differed between open/closed renders. Moved the hook above the early return.
  - SettingsModal auth panel: tightened `.auth-panel-body` horizontal padding from `--space-xl` (24px) to `--space-md` (12px), giving each provider card more horizontal room.

  Paperclip runtime:

  - CLI parity: in the dashboard's "Local CLI" tab, Test / fetch companies / fetch agents now actually shell out to `paperclipai` instead of making HTTP calls through a derived URL. New CLI-backed variants (`probePaperclipViaCli`, `listCompaniesViaCli`, `listCompanyAgentsViaCli`, `createIssueViaCli`, `getIssueViaCli`, `agentsMeViaCli`) drive every Paperclip call that has a CLI counterpart; the runtime adapter routes through them when `transport=cli`. `getIssueComments` / `wakeAgent` / `getRunEvents` continue using HTTP (no matching `paperclipai` subcommands) but rely on the apiKey discovered from the local paperclipai config so CLI mode works end-to-end.
  - New dashboard routes `/providers/paperclip/cli-status`, `/cli-companies`, `/cli-agents` exposing the CLI helpers.

  Plugin runtime registry:

  - `GET /api/plugins/runtimes` now merges a bundled hermes/openclaw/paperclip fallback list on top of installed plugins, so the NewAgentDialog "Plugin Runtime" dropdown populates without requiring `fn plugin install` on a fresh setup. Installed plugins override the bundled entry by `runtimeId`. Coalesced the optional `version` field to `"0.0.0"` to satisfy the bundled-runtime type.

  Core:

  - Schema migration fix: bumped `SCHEMA_VERSION` from 48 → 49 so migration 49 (per-task `nodeId` column for remote-node routing) actually runs. Existing DBs at version 48 hit the early-return guard, never created the column, and `TaskStore.listTasks` crashed at startup with `no such column: nodeId` — the dashboard exited before initialization. The bump unblocks app startup on any pre-existing 0.7.0 install.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b30e017: feat(runtimes): real Hermes / OpenClaw / Paperclip runtime plugins

  Replaces the stub runtime plugins with end-to-end working integrations:

  - **Hermes** runtime drives the local `hermes` CLI as a subprocess (`hermes chat -q ... -Q --source tool [--resume <id>]`), captures session ids for continuity, with profile picker (HERMES_HOME-based switching) and Nous Research co-brand.
  - **OpenClaw** runtime drives `openclaw --no-color agent --local --json --session-id <uuid> --message <prompt>`, parses the OpenAI-compatible JSON output, surfaces visible/reasoning text via callbacks; defaults to embedded mode (no daemon required).
  - **Paperclip** runtime now uses the modern `POST /api/agents/{id}/wakeup` + heartbeat-run streaming API (replaces the old issue-checkout + heartbeat-invoke flow); supports both API mode (URL + bearer) and CLI mode (auto-derives URL from `~/.paperclip/instances/default/config.json`); company + agent dropdowns; CLI key bootstrap via `paperclipai agent local-cli`.

  Engine fix: `agent-session-helpers.ts:createResolvedAgentSession` now attaches the resolved runtime's `promptWithFallback` to the session so pi's dispatch hook routes prompts through the plugin runtime instead of falling through to pi's native path.

  Dashboard adds a unified `RuntimeCardShell` component, real provider logos (caduceus, pixel-lobster, paperclip outline), Test/Save/Save & Test buttons with success/failure toasts, "Learn more →" links, and a "Runtimes" group in Settings.

  Backend adds `GET /providers/{hermes,openclaw,paperclip}/status`, `GET /providers/hermes/profiles`, `GET /providers/paperclip/{companies,agents,cli-discovery}`, `POST /providers/paperclip/cli-mint-key`.

  Plugin SDK: now ships a proper `dist/` build (was previously TS-source-only), unblocking runtime imports from compiled plugins.

### Patch Changes

- ec09282: Add dashboard vitest process controls with a new `POST /api/kill-vitest` endpoint and System Stats modal UI for manual kills plus auto-kill settings management.
- 92b8631: Fix automation execution pipeline reliability by improving ProjectEngine automation startup diagnostics and health visibility, adding due-schedule regression coverage, and fixing manual automation runs to execute ai-prompt and create-task steps (including continueOnFailure handling) instead of command-only behavior.
- 8fbd3bd: Fix plugin-install loader taskStore compatibility by ensuring CLI plugin install paths are covered with regression tests for `getRootDir` expectations.
- 347cae8: Load enabled plugins during dashboard, serve, and daemon startup so plugin runtimes are available to agent runtime selection immediately after boot.
- 0a5dcf1: Fix `/api/system-stats` so process/system metrics still return when project resolution fails, with task and agent aggregates gracefully falling back to zero counts.
- 3c8a490: Fix `fn plugin install` failing in CLI plugin commands by adding `getRootDir()` to the mock TaskStore used by `createPluginLoader`.
- 637f435: Fix pi-claude-cli planning hangs by simplifying custom MCP tool guidance to direct `mcp__custom-tools__*` calls (no `ToolSearch` prerequisite), aligning custom-tool handling diagnostics, and adding regression coverage for `ls`/triage MCP tool mapping behavior.
- 7691bab: Respect globalPause/enginePaused in heartbeat trigger scheduler and monitor to prevent agents from running when the engine is paused at startup.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- f4d98ed: Add a `--git` flag to `fn init` to auto-initialize a git repository (including an initial commit) when the target directory is not already a git repo.
- 6caab17: Add project settings to auto-comment on imported GitHub issues when tasks move to done, plus dashboard GitHub integration support for posting issue comments.
- fdf8ca9: Reframe the CLI splash to "multi node agent orchestrator" with `runfusion.ai` and the current version, and surface the version alongside URL/host/auth/uptime in the dashboard System panel and status bar.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b969635: v0.5.0: status terminology refresh (planning/replan), Reviewer rename, in-review pause behavior, dashboard-tui resize hardening, dev-server experimental toggle fix, and version reporting fix.

### Patch Changes

- 112ad67: Fix experimental feature save normalization so disabling Dev Server clears the legacy `devServer` alias (`null` delete) alongside canonical `devServerView`, preventing stale nav visibility after save.
- 16ec204: Fix dashboard health/version reporting to read the version from package.json instead of relying on npm_package_version with a stale hardcoded fallback.
- 79ce48c: Fix pausing behavior for in-review tasks so stop fully halts merge activity. Paused in-review tasks are now marked with paused status, removed from merge queues, active merge sessions are aborted/disposed, self-healing recovery skips paused tasks, and unpausing re-enqueues eligible review tasks for auto-merge.
- c85ffa9: Rename status values: specifying→planning, needs-respecify→needs-replan. Display label "Triage"→"Planning". Includes DB migration for existing records.
- 03a48ae: Update dashboard and CLI status strings: specifying→planning, needs-respecify→needs-replan. Update user-facing text from "triage/specify" terminology to "planning/replan" terminology.
- c1b0121: Rename "Validator" to "Reviewer" across all dashboard UI labels and descriptions.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- b5200ba: Add Cloudflare Quick Tunnel mode for Remote Access so Fusion can auto-provision an ephemeral `trycloudflare.com` URL via `cloudflared tunnel --url` without requiring a pre-created named tunnel or tunnel token.
- 8097db2: Rename status values: specifying→planning, needs-respecify→needs-replan. Display label "Triage"→"Planning". Includes DB migration for existing records.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d8852e: Add project-level overlap ignore paths so teams can exempt safe shared files/directories from overlap-based task serialization while keeping overlap protection enabled for the rest of the repo.

### Patch Changes

- f560af5: Fix dashboard TUI agents view run history rendering to use readable status labels and allow opening selected run logs reliably.
- cd4cef3: Fix dashboard TUI agent run-log opening so Enter key presses sent as carriage-return/newline characters are recognized reliably.
- 7e05a20: Speed up `fn init` project-name detection by skipping git remote lookup when the target directory is not a git repository. This avoids unnecessary subprocess work and reduces timeout risk in test/CI environments.
- c818d71: Inset plugin manager cards from the modal edges on mobile. The plugins subsection panel had no horizontal padding while its heading and toggle were already inset, leaving cards flush with the modal frame on small screens.
- c818d71: Fix triage hangs when using pi-claude-cli with claude-sonnet-4-6. Parameterless custom tools (e.g. `fn_review_spec`) emit zero `input_json_delta` events from the Claude CLI, so the event bridge previously fell through to a raw empty-string fallback and pi's TypeBox validator rejected the call with "root: must be object" — looping the agent indefinitely. Defaults empty `partialJson` to `{}`. Also adds a reminder loop before the planning fallback model engages, propagates the bundled `@runfusion/fusion` extension into engine sessions so `fn_*` tools register without `pi install`, and drops the "historical" qualifier from replayed tool labels that was confusing models into treating their own prior turns as a previous session.
- ff6a68b: Fix Skills Catalog initial-load failures by preventing unauthenticated public search requests for empty or too-short queries. The dashboard now returns a successful empty catalog result for short-query unauthenticated/fallback states instead of surfacing upstream 400 errors.
- 1b3994f: Fix the dashboard terminal modal desktop width contract so large displays use a broad viewport-based layout, and harden terminal input lifecycle handling so xterm keyboard input continues forwarding reliably after rerenders.
- 1a8058f: Make agent pause/resume state transitions act immediately by stopping active heartbeat runs on pause and triggering an on-demand heartbeat on resume.
- 39622f0: Fix scheduled automations so overdue runs catch up reliably after server downtime. Startup/settings sync no longer pushes unchanged overdue schedules into the future, and memory dreams automation is now synchronized during engine startup before cron begins ticking.
- 26f9c74: Synchronize Fusion skill documentation from `extension.ts` across `SKILL.md`, `references/extension-tools.md`, and `references/fusion-capabilities.md`, and document engine session-scoped runtime tools in a new `references/engine-tools.md` reference.

## Unreleased

### Patch Changes

- FN-2501: Agent pause/resume controls now act immediately. Pausing stops an active heartbeat run right away, and resuming to `active` triggers an immediate on-demand heartbeat instead of waiting for the next timer tick.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- adbad8a: Add `fn plugin add` as a backward-compatible alias for `fn plugin install`, and update plugin command help text to advertise the alias while keeping `install` as the canonical command.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- dbc9446: Add a blocking dashboard token-recovery dialog that appears only for daemon bearer-token 401 responses, with set-token or clear-token recovery actions that reload the app.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 69f789f: TUI: layered defenses for the resize / wrong-height-layout bug

  Materially reduces (but doesn't fully eliminate) the symptom of the header rendering off-screen or the layout taking 1-2 too many rows, especially under tmux/ssh.

  - Enter alternate-screen buffer on start; leave on stop. The TUI gets a dedicated fullscreen surface that doesn't share scrollback.
  - StatusBar Text children no longer wrap (default `wrap="wrap"` was letting long hotkey + URL strings wrap to 2 rows, throwing the row budget off by 1).
  - Controller subscribes to `process.stdout` "resize" and calls `inkInstance.clear()` to reset log-update's frame tracking.
  - App-level resize listener + key-based remount on dimension change so React rebuilds the tree from scratch with fresh bounds.
  - Root Box gets explicit width + overflow="hidden"; MainHeader outer Box too.
  - Settings + Utilities side-by-side now stretch to equal heights (UtilitiesPanel switched from `flexShrink={0}` to `flexGrow={1}`).

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 88b4ecb: TUI fixes: help overlay no longer crashes, header stays rendered

  - Help overlay (`?` / `h`) crashed with "Encountered two children with the same key" because several shortcut entries share the same display key (`[t]` for Git view AND for Toggle engine pause; `[r]` for Refresh stats AND Refresh agent detail). Switch to index-based keys — each row is unique by position, not by character.
  - Refresh the help text to reflect the unified header (`[m]` Main, `[b/a/g/t/e]` views), the Settings/Files/Agents `←/→` pane swap, the Git push/fetch shortcuts, the Files hidden-files toggle, and the Logs `G` jump-to-end.
  - Main view (status mode) header sometimes vanished after a tmux pane switch and stayed missing until a terminal resize. Two fixes: (a) drop the `rows < 10` auto-hide in `MainHeader` — tmux pane switches can briefly report stale or zero dimensions, and a transient `return null` was orphaning the header. (b) Wrap `MainHeader` and `StatusBar` in `flexShrink={0}` boxes inside `StatusModeGrid` and `StatusModeSingle` (matching the prior fix in `InteractiveMode`), so Yoga can't squeeze them to 0 rows when content pressures the row budget.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 0f070d8: TUI header redesign and Settings ←/→ pane navigation

  - Replace the dual section + interactive tab strips with a single unified strip: `[m] Main  [b] Board  [a] Agents  [g] Settings  [t] Git  [e] Explorer`. Status mode highlights the Main pill; interactive views highlight their own. Number-key shortcuts (1–5) for status sections still work but are no longer rendered in the header chrome.
  - Width tiers now fit comfortably at every terminal size: full labels at cols ≥ 90, glyph-only at 50–89 (every shortcut still visible), FUSION + active pill only below 50. Help/quit shows at cols ≥ 110.
  - New `m` shortcut switches to status mode (Main); `s` kept as alias.
  - Settings interactive view: `←` focuses the list pane, `→` focuses the detail pane. `Tab` still cycles either way (consistent with Agents view).

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 58688fa: Keep the FUSION header from wrapping when the terminal is narrow. The `MiniLogo` and tab pills had Yoga's default `flexShrink: 1`, so the row's collective content overrunning the width was being absorbed by shrinking every child — including FUSION, which then wrapped to two lines. Pin all fixed-content header children to `flexShrink={0}`; the trailing flexGrow filler absorbs slack instead.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 07d7bac: Add a blocking dashboard token-recovery dialog that appears only for daemon bearer-token 401 responses, with set-token or clear-token recovery actions that reload the app.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a8f5591: Add support for an optional custom ntfy server URL in notification settings, with default fallback to `https://ntfy.sh` when unset.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- c105cfa: Automatically install the bundled Fusion skill into supported agent home directories during `fn init` (`~/.claude/skills/fusion`, `~/.codex/skills/fusion`, and `~/.gemini/skills/fusion`) when missing. Existing installs are preserved, and per-target filesystem errors now warn without failing project initialization.
- 86521e2: Fix `pnpm install -g @runfusion/fusion` failing with a 404 for `@fusion/pi-claude-cli`. The vendored pi extension is now bundled into the published package's `dist/pi-claude-cli/` and is no longer listed as an external dependency.
- 76961d4: Add a severity filter to the interactive `fn dashboard` TUI Logs tab. Users can now press `f` to cycle `all → info → warn → error` for view-only filtering while preserving the full in-memory ring buffer.
- f77dd9d: Prevent stale dashboard service workers from trapping old client bundles, and compute automation cron schedules against UTC so monthly runs stay on day 1 across timezones.
- f4d2a4b: Fix `fn dashboard` Logs tab row budgeting so log lines stay above the footer hint on short terminals, including wrapped-message cases.
- f77dd9d: Fix dashboard SSE cleanup on browser refresh so stale event streams do not exhaust per-origin browser connections.
- 31f021a: Fix dashboard TUI log severity rendering so structured `logger.log(...)` entries routed via `stderr` display with info severity/icon instead of being misclassified as errors.
- eef56af: Normalize Fusion skill-facing tool naming to the public `fn_*` namespace and clarify the boundary between extension tools and internal engine runtime tools across skill docs.
- 832c32c: Refresh the shipped Fusion skill documentation to match the current `fn_*` extension and CLI surfaces, and replace stale kb-era task/storage examples with Fusion-native `FN-*` and `.fusion` conventions.
- dce70bf: Persist `fn dashboard` bearer tokens in the existing global settings store (`~/.fusion/settings.json`) on first authenticated run, then reuse them on subsequent starts. Explicit overrides (`--token`, `FUSION_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, `FUSION_DAEMON_TOKEN`) and `--no-auth` precedence remain intact.
- f078a4e: Add a Settings → Pi Extensions action to reinstall Fusion's bundled Pi package (`npm:@runfusion/fusion`) for self-serve recovery when local Pi skill installs are stale or broken.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 9bf2981: Add a `planning-awaiting-input` ntfy notification event so users can opt in to alerts when planning sessions pause for user input.
- Fix the CLI init command import path for the Claude skills runner so tsup can resolve it during build.
- 94473c8: Improve dashboard shutdown observability by logging non-fatal diagnostics when `CentralCore.close()` fails during dispose, normal signal shutdown, or dev-mode shutdown cleanup.
- Fix dashboard and serve command plugin store initialization to support task store implementations that expose `getFusionDir()` without `getRootDir()`.
- c01892d: Route dashboard runtime diagnostics through the shared injected runtime logger so TTY sessions can capture server/package logs in the TUI while preserving readable non-TTY startup banner output.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 39f7709: Dashboard TUI now surfaces engine log output in the Logs tab. Previously, the engine's `createLogger()` writes (scheduler, executor, triage, merger, PR monitor, heartbeat, etc.) went straight to `console.error` and were rendered beneath the alt-screen TUI — effectively invisible. `DashboardLogSink.captureConsole()` now intercepts `console.log/warn/error` while the TUI is running and routes each line into the ring buffer, parsing a leading `[prefix]` tag so entries carry the subsystem prefix. Originals are restored on TUI shutdown.
- 585e480: Add keyboard navigation and inspection features to the Dashboard TUI Logs tab: arrow keys and j/k to navigate entries, Enter to expand selected entry, Esc to close expanded view, and w to toggle wrap mode for long messages.
- 86fd24e: `fn dashboard` TTY mode now opens on the System tab first so users immediately see host, port, URL, and auth token access details.
- 585e480: Fix dashboard TUI log navigation: add Home/End shortcuts for jumping to first/last log entry, add Space and e keys as alternatives to Enter for expanding logs, improve word wrap to handle long unbroken tokens (URLs, stack traces) by hard-wrapping them at terminal width.
- 7d31b21: Fix iOS terminal typing in the dashboard. On touch-primary devices, tapping the terminal opened the on-screen keyboard but keystrokes were silently dropped because the bubble-phase `handleTerminalGestureFocus` handler re-focused the helper textarea and reset its selection during touchstart/pointerdown, disrupting iOS's input-event attribution. The CSS fix in commit c7266b7f already positions the textarea to receive taps natively, so the JS handler is now a no-op on `(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` devices and desktop retains click-to-focus.
- Fix dashboard TUI log viewport row calculation on very small terminals to prevent log lines from overlapping the footer.
- ff5df16: Fix executor model resolution precedence so project `defaultProviderOverride`/`defaultModelIdOverride` is honored before falling back to global `defaultProvider`/`defaultModelId` across execute, hot-swap, and step-session paths.
- df2836c: Fix dashboard TUI log behavior so log navigation can reach all entries still present in the ring buffer and streamed merge output is buffered into log lines instead of writing raw fragments into the interactive terminal UI.
- bbdd11a: Guard SQLite FTS5 usage so Fusion starts cleanly on Node builds whose bundled `node:sqlite` was compiled without FTS5. On affected systems, `fn dashboard` previously crashed on first run with `Error: no such module: fts5` during schema migration. The Database and ArchiveDatabase now probe for FTS5 at startup and skip the virtual table + triggers when unavailable; `TaskStore.searchTasks` and `ArchiveDatabase.search` fall back to LIKE-based scans. Set `FUSION_DISABLE_FTS5=1` to force the fallback on runtimes where FTS5 is present but undesirable.
- 0bb0100: Update dashboard TUI header branding from "fn board" to "fusion" for consistent product naming.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 25d44e1: Add interactive TUI to `fn dashboard` with five navigable sections: logs, system, utilities, stats, and settings. Keyboard shortcuts enable quick in-terminal navigation (1-5, arrows, q, Ctrl+C, ? for help). The TUI activates automatically in interactive terminal sessions; non-TTY mode (CI, piped output) retains the existing plain-text banner/log behavior.

### Patch Changes

- a2ed6d0: Fixes for stuck merges and agent lifecycle controls.

  - `findLandedTaskCommit` now falls back to scanning all of `HEAD` when the bounded `baseCommitSha..HEAD` range returns no commits (e.g. baseCommitSha was advanced past the landed merge by a fast-forward rebase). Previously the recovery silently returned null and re-queued the merge even though the commit had already landed.
  - Agent heartbeat triggers and registration are gated by `runtimeConfig.enabled` rather than transient agent state, so paused/idle/error agents stay registered for triggers and re-arm immediately on resume without waiting for a state transition.
  - `AgentDetailView` exposes a Stop control alongside Pause/Retry for `running` and `error` states so operators can terminate stuck agents without going through the agents list.

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Re-ship three previously reverted fixes and add pre-merge remote rebase.

  - `--no-auth` flag now correctly suppresses bearer-token auth instead of being silently overridden by a stale `FUSION_DAEMON_TOKEN` in the project's `.env`.
  - Workflow-review revisions reopen only the last step rather than resetting every previously-completed step. The agent applies the feedback as an in-place fix and earlier approved work stays done. New `reopenLastStepForRevision` helper is used by `handleWorkflowRevisionRequest`, `handleWorkflowStepFailure`, and `sendTaskBackForFix`. `determineRevisionResetStart` is marked `@deprecated` and kept exported for tests.
  - Heartbeat scheduling is now driven by `agent.state` (`active`/`running` = timer armed; everything else = timer cleared), not `runtimeConfig.enabled`. Resuming a paused agent through the dashboard now re-arms the timer immediately.
  - New setting `worktreeRebaseBeforeMerge` (default `true`) and companion `worktreeRebaseRemote` (default: git's configured default). The merger fetches the remote and rebases the task branch onto the latest default-branch tip before merging; conflicts flow into the existing smart/AI resolve cascade. Dashboard Settings → Worktrees exposes a checkbox and a remote dropdown populated from `/api/git/remotes/detailed`.
  - Last/Next heartbeat labels on the agent list card now share font-size and inline-flex alignment so they line up cleanly.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 41553a5: Harden agent lifecycle around closed tasks and heartbeat defaults.

  - `HeartbeatMonitor.executeHeartbeat()` now exits before session creation when the resolved task is done/archived (reason `task_closed`) and clears the stale `agent.taskId` linkage so the guard isn't re-tripped on every tick.
  - `HeartbeatTriggerScheduler.watchAssignments()` skips callback dispatch when the assigned task is already closed (when a `taskStore` is wired in).
  - `POST /api/agents/:id/runs` performs the same preflight check and returns 409 with a structured error naming the task id + column, keeping the existing active-run 409 precedence.
  - `AgentStore.createAgent()` now persists `runtimeConfig.heartbeatIntervalMs` (default 1h) on non-ephemeral agents so the dashboard's freshness signal matches the scheduler's effective cadence instead of depending on whether the user ever opened the heartbeat dropdown. Exports a new `DEFAULT_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` constant.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 0da498a: Fix dashboard onboarding auth token controls, keep the AI planning modal footer visible on desktop, and add better terminal PTY spawn diagnostics.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 1fc72d1: Improve the dashboard agents list views with shared empty-state actions, token-based state styling, and clearer board/tree/org-chart presentation.
- 46b8032: Make `fn agent import` import package skills alongside agents when importing from directory or archive sources. Skills are written to `{project}/skills/imported/{company-slug}/{skill-slug}/SKILL.md` with proper frontmatter formatting. Existing skill files are skipped rather than overwritten. Single AGENTS.md file imports do not include package skills.
- c1bc5b9: Fix CLI merge regressions in test/build verification: restore gh-cli test alias resolution, ensure daemon ignores invalid env tokens, and restore required changeset config.
- 06704cf: Fix the setup wizard directory browser and make terminal session startup more resilient.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Add `fusion` bin alias so `npx @runfusion/fusion` resolves to the CLI
  (the `fn` command is still available and unchanged).

## 0.0.1

### Initial release

First public release under the `@runfusion` scope. Package was previously
developed under the `@gsxdsm/fusion` name; it was never published to npm,
so version history resets with `0.0.1`. Pre-release notes preserved below
for reference.

---

## 0.4.0 (pre-release, unpublished)

### Minor Changes

- 2d13b82: Add pi extension. Installing `@runfusion/fusion` via `pi install` now provides native tools (`fn_task_create`, `fn_task_list`, `fn_task_show`, `fn_task_attach`, `fn_task_pause`, `fn_task_unpause`) and a `/fn` command to start the dashboard and AI engine from within a pi session.
- 494de14: Changed `autoMerge` to default to `true` for new boards.
- 50821fc: Add global pause button to stop all automated agents and scheduling
- cac10af: Split engine control into Pause (soft) and Stop (hard). The dashboard Header now shows two buttons: "Pause AI engine" stops new work from being dispatched while letting in-flight agents finish gracefully, and "Stop AI engine" (previously the only Pause button) immediately kills all active agent sessions. A new `enginePaused` setting field controls the soft-pause state alongside the existing `globalPause` hard-stop.

### Patch Changes

- d19b51f: Auto-assign random port when dashboard port is already in use instead of crashing with EADDRINUSE.
- ceb379d: Engine pause now terminates active agent sessions (matching global pause behavior) instead of letting them finish gracefully. Tasks are moved back to todo/cleared for clean resume on unpause.
- acb246a: Fix active agent glow disappearing when scheduling is soft-paused
- 43aada5: Fix scheduler to not count in-review worktrees against maxWorktrees limit. In-review tasks are idle (waiting to merge) and no longer block new tasks from starting.
- 9033a79: Fix InlineCreateCard cancelling when clicking dependency dropdown items with empty description.
- 96f1070: Fix double horizontal scrollbar on mobile board view by switching the board from a 5-column grid to a flex layout on narrow viewports (≤768px) with snap-scrolling.
- 3dc741c: Fix auto-pause on rate limit when pi-coding-agent exhausts retries. After `session.prompt()` resolves with exhausted retries, all four agent types (executor, triage, merger, reviewer) now detect the error on `session.state.error` and trigger `UsageLimitPauser` to activate global pause. Previously, rate-limit errors that pi-coding-agent handled internally were silently swallowed, causing tasks to be promoted to wrong columns with incomplete work.
- 2854553: Fix triage allowing tasks to reach executor before spec review approval
- 72a8953: Fix specifying agents not respecting maxConcurrent concurrency limit
- a2a12f9: Persist worktree pool across engine restarts. When `recycleWorktrees` is enabled, idle worktrees are rehydrated from disk on startup instead of being forgotten. When disabled, orphaned worktrees are cleaned up automatically.
- 65b9585: Add priority-based agent scheduling: merge agents are served before execution agents, which are served before specification agents, when competing for concurrency slots.
- 98ed082: Restructure README to lead with pi extension usage; move standalone CLI docs to STANDALONE.md.
- 2d13b82: Agents now declare dependencies when creating multiple related tasks during execution
- 0e0643a: Skip merger agent when squash merge stages nothing (branch already merged via dependency)
- d2e2e50: Make "Pause AI engine" a soft pause: only prevents new agents from starting while allowing currently running agents to finish their work naturally. "Stop AI engine" (global pause) still immediately terminates all active agents.
- 90764b9: Auto-pause engine when API usage limits are detected (rate limits, overloaded, quota exceeded). Prevents wasteful retries across concurrent agents.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ae90be0: Bundle workspace packages into CLI for npm publish. The published package previously declared dependencies on private `@kb/core`, `@kb/dashboard`, and `@kb/engine` workspace packages, causing `npm install` to fail. Switched the CLI build from `tsc` to `tsup` (esbuild) to inline all `@kb/*` workspace code into a single bundled `dist/bin.js`, while keeping third-party packages (`express`, `multer`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`) as external dependencies. Dashboard client assets are now copied into `dist/client/` so the published tarball is fully self-contained.
- 28bbcb9: Exclude Bun-compiled platform binaries from npm publish tarball, reducing package size significantly.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fc7582d: Expand agent.log logging to all agent types, additionally capturing thinking, and agent roles
- cc999ef: RETHINK verdicts trigger git reset and conversation rewind, re-prompting the agent with feedback

### Patch Changes

- f3c7f7d: CLI `task create` now supports a `--depends <id>` flag (repeatable) to declare task dependencies at creation time.
- fc7582d: Code review REVISE verdicts are now enforced such that agents can no longer advance steps without APPROVE
- cc999ef: Plan RETHINK triggers conversation rewind with REVISE enforcement on code reviews
- cc999ef: Dependent tasks can start from in-review dependency branches instead of waiting for merge

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- efdb7de: Clean up README: plain ASCII file tree, mermaid workflow diagram with column descriptions, update quick start to use `kb` CLI, add authentication section to CLI README, document cross-model review in executor description.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b12d340: Add automated versioning pipeline using changesets. Developers now add changeset files to describe changes, and a CI workflow automatically opens version PRs that bump versions and generate changelogs.
