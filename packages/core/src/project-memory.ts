/**
 * Project Memory Bootstrap
 *
 * Provides the canonical path and default scaffold for `.fusion/memory/MEMORY.md`,
 * plus idempotent `ensure` functions that create memory only when missing.
 *
 * This module supports both file-based (direct filesystem) and backend-aware
 * memory operations. Backend-aware operations use the configured memory backend
 * for storage, enabling pluggable backends like QMD.
 *
 * Key behaviors:
 * - Bootstrap is idempotent: existing memory is NEVER overwritten
 * - Non-writable backends do not throw during bootstrap (non-fatal)
 * - Backend selection is based on project settings
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for:
 * - The memory file path relative to project root
 * - The default scaffold content for a new memory file
 * - The memory instruction templates used by triage and executor prompts

   - Conventions or standards that should be followed
   - Pitfalls or anti-patterns to avoid in future work
   - Important constraints or context that affects implementation decisions
6. **Avoid** writing task-specific trivia such as:
   - Per-task implementation logs or changelog entries
   - Transient failures resolved without broader lessons
   - One-off file paths, variable names, or minor code changes
   - Notes about what you did rather than what future agents should know
7. **Consolidate when possible**: If an existing entry already covers a concept, update or refine it rather than adding a duplicate. Delete entries that are no longer accurate.

**Format for additions:** Add bullet points under the relevant section heading:
- Use \`- \` prefix for list items
- Keep entries concise and actionable
