    //      worker never gets its isolated cwd. Tests that rely on cwd being a
    //      disposable temp dir would silently operate in the repo root.
    //
    //   2. setup-test-isolation.ts:15-16 — `process.env.HOME` is written
    //      unconditionally in every setupFile invocation. Threads share
    //      `process.env`, so concurrent workers race on HOME and the last writer
    //      wins, breaking isolation for all other workers in the same run.
